# Pole-Game

## Description

Pole Game is an addictive hypercasual iPhone game designed to emulate a real world hockey game. The application is written in C# and uses Unity version 2019.4. All in game objects/assets were created in Unity or downloaded for free from the Unity Asset Store. Sounds were either downloaded or recorded on an iPhone and edited in Audacity. The game includes multiple settings to play in, many easter eggs, and purchaseable in-app content. The project is no longer being worked on, but could be improved upon with the addition of features such as an instructions view, android compatibility, and an online leaderboard.

##Installation

Download free on Apple App Store. Works on most iPhones.
